🎓 I graduated with a major in Applied Computer Science in the Information Technology field from Hanoi University of Mining and Geology (HUMG), and I also completed a Software Engineering Diploma at Aptech.

💡 I have experience in software development, Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and software testing, with a strong focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). I am currently working on LLM-powered AI Agents, designing intelligent workflows that leverage prompt engineering, tool calling, and automation to solve real-world problems. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in automation testing, including UI testing, test case design, and using automated testing tools to enhance system quality and reliability.

🚀 My goal is to become a tech engineer who applies AI and automation to optimize systems, enhance product quality, and improve workflow efficiency. I'm always eager to learn, stay updated with new technologies, and take on challenges that create real-world value.

🔧 Key Skills: Automation Testing, Python, Git, Selenium (if applicable), problem-solving, teamwork, fast learning.

👉 “Always learning – Always improving.”
